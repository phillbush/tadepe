TADEPE is shity a 8x16 bitmap font of questionable aesthetics for X11.
• ASCII; latin extensions; greek letters; {sub,super}scripts; braille;
  box drawing characters; math symbols; etc.
• It is very incomplete and lacks most characters and scripts.
  (glyphs are added by necessity).
• Lowercase Latin letters do not have the ascender stem
  (lowercase B/T/K resemble cyrillic minuscules, for example).
• Lowercase J/I do not have tittle (they are undotted).
  (Turkish and its two i-s is not supported).
• Larger pixel sizes (16x32 and 32x64) are enlarged from 8x16.

                 (See ./demos/*.png for demonstration.)

                                 * * *

BUILD Tadepe with make.  It will generated composite characters; braille
characters and large font sizes.

	$ make

INSTALL Tadepe on ~/.fonts; make the font indices; and reload XServer's
font database:

	$ make install

USE one of those X11 Logical Font Description (XLFD) to match Tadepe:

	$ xlsfonts
	[…]
	-misc-tadepe-bold-r-normal--16-160-75-75-c-80-iso10646-1
	-misc-tadepe-bold-r-normal--32-320-75-75-c-80-iso10646-1
	-misc-tadepe-bold-r-normal--64-640-75-75-c-80-iso10646-1

USE one of those FontConfig pattern to match Tadepe (`pixelsize` may be
needed to force pixel size, for tadepe is not scalable):

	$ fc-list
	[…]
	Tadepe:pixelsize=16:style=bold
	Tadepe:pixelsize=32:style=bold
	Tadepe:pixelsize=64:style=bold

                                 * * *

TODO:
☠ Fix diacritics on uppercase letters
☠ Fix drawing characters
☠ Create 12x24 variants.
☠ Create non-monospace variants (use Apple's Chicago as reference?).
☠ Create slanted/italic variants.
☠ (Re)write normal (non-bold) style (not maintained anymore).
☠ Draw more glyphs.
☠ Write script to generate specimen/demo image.
☡ Write script to generate pre-composed accented letters from base
  letters and combining diacritics.
