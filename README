                                 TADEPE

Tadepe is a shitty bitmap font for X11 with ugly glyphs.

Tadepe was originally Spleen (used by OpenBSD) and shares the same
license. However, Tadepe has diverged and it is now very different
from Spleen.

Tadepe is very incomplete and lacks support for lots of Glyphs.
Glyphs are added by necessity.

Tadepe does not support Turkish and its two i-s.

Tadepe currently has font files for 8x16 glyphs in regular and bold
fonts.  I may add other sizes.
